# Expo CLI: React-Native-Web Compatibility Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when integrating certain React Native libraries with Expo's `react-native-web` support.  The error might manifest differently depending on the library, but generally results in unexpected behavior or crashes when running the Expo app in a web browser.

## Problem

Many React Native libraries make assumptions about the environment they are running in (native iOS/Android).  When using Expo's web support, these assumptions might break if the library doesn't properly handle the differences between the native and web environments.

## Solution

The solution often involves:

1. **Identifying the Incompatible Library:**  Pinpoint which library is causing the problem.  Console logs and debugging tools are useful here.
2. **Checking for Web Support:**  See if the library explicitly supports `react-native-web`. The library's documentation or issue tracker is a good place to check.
3. **Using a Web-Friendly Alternative:** If the library lacks web support, you may need to find a different library that's compatible with `react-native-web`. 
4. **Conditional Rendering or Polyfills:** For some cases, you might be able to use conditional rendering to bypass problematic sections of code depending on the platform or provide polyfills for missing web APIs.
5. **Reporting the Issue:** If you believe you've found a bug in the library itself, consider reporting it on the library's issue tracker.
