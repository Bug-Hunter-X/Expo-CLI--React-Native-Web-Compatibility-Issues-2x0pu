The solution requires careful debugging to isolate the incompatible library. Here's a hypothetical example illustrating a problem with a library that uses `Dimensions` and how you might address it.

**bug.js**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';
import IncompatibleLibrary from 'incompatible-library';

const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => (
  <IncompatibleLibrary width={width} />
);

export default MyComponent;
```

**bugSolution.js**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Dimensions, Platform } from 'react-native';
import IncompatibleLibrary from 'incompatible-library';

let width;

if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  width = window.innerWidth; // Use the browser's window width for web
} else {
  const { width: nativeWidth } = Dimensions.get('window');
  width = nativeWidth; // Use React Native's Dimensions for native
}

const MyComponent = () => (
  <IncompatibleLibrary width={width} />
);

export default MyComponent;
```
This example uses conditional rendering based on the platform to handle the difference in how `Dimensions` works between native and web. Remember to replace `'incompatible-library'` with the actual name of your problematic library.
