This error typically occurs when using Expo's `react-native-web` integration with a library that's not fully compatible.  It manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes, especially on web platforms. The root cause is often a mismatch between the library's assumptions about the environment (native vs. web) and the actual environment provided by Expo.
